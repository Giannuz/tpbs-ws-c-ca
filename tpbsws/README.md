# tpbsws

Implement a Thread Pool Based Static Web Server (tpbsws). The Web Server assigns each request to a new task and submits it to a Thread Pool having size = 2;.


Prepare a folder called SP and place the Web Server executable jar file, called tpbsws.jar, and a subfolder called “staticcontentrepository” containing the HTML files to be downloaded in such a folder. 



Create an HTML file called “file1.html” to test the server and place it in the “staticcontentrepository” subfolder.
